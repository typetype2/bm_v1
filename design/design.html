This piece was the culmination of a design and research project, centred around cold war espionage equipment, that were integrated into everyday objects, from watches to attach√© cases. Concealed out in the open, these cameras were made out of re-purposed materials, so they could be hidden in plain sight. Whilst being aesthetically pleasing, the object is also a fully functioning pinhole camera, capable of producing images itself.</p>

The design adheres to era specific styling, with particular attention paid to typography, colour use, and paper choice; the original spelling of Macintosh was used, in the place of the adulteration in use by the brand today.</p>
